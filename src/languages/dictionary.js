              investments by assessing what’s working, where opportunities for

            </p>

            <h3>Recruitment, Assessment or Selection Process</h3>
            <p>
              Acosta/Mosaic Sales Solutions will notify job applicants, when

              assessment or selection process that accommodations are available
              upon request in relation to the materials or processes to be used.
            </p>

            <p>

            <p>
              Acosta/Mosaic Sales Solutions will continue to inform its
              employees of its policies (and any updates to those policies) used
              to support employees with disabilities, including policies on the
              provision of job accommodations that take into account an
              employee’s accessibility needs due to disability. This information
              will be provided to new employees as soon as practicable after
              commencing employment.
            </p>

            <h3>Accessible Formats and Communication Supports for Employees</h3>
            <p>
              Upon the request of an employee with a disability, Acosta/Mosaic
              Sales Solutions will consult with the employee to provide, or
              arrange for the provision of, accessible formats and communication
              supports for information that is needed to perform his/her job,
              and information that is generally available to other employees.
            </p>

            <p>
              In determining the suitability of an accessible format or
              communication support, Acosta/Mosaic Sales Solutions will consult
              with the employee making the request. However, the company
              reserves the flexibility to decide on the most appropriate
              accessible formats or communication supports for employees (based
              on the needs of the specific employee and the capacity of the
              company to provide the support).
            </p>

            <h3>Workplace Emergency Response Information</h3>

            <p>
              Acosta/Mosaic Sales Solutions will provide individualized
              workplace emergency response information to employees who have a
              disability, if the disability is such that the individualized
              information is necessary, and if Acosta/Mosaic Sales Solutions is
              aware of the need for accommodation due to the employee’s
              disability. Acosta/Mosaic Sales Solutions will provide this
              information as soon as practicable after becoming aware of the
              need for accommodation.
            </p>

            <p>
              Where the employee requires assistance, Acosta/Mosaic Sales
              Solutions will, with the consent of the employee, provide the
              workplace emergency response information to the person designated
              by Acosta/Mosaic Sales Solutions to provide assistance to the
              employee.
            </p>

            <p>
              Acosta/Mosaic Sales Solutions will review the individualized
              workplace emergency response information when the employee moves
              to a different location in the organization, when the employee’s
              overall accommodations needs or when plans are reviewed.
            </p>

            <h3>Documented Individual Accommodation Plans</h3>
            <p>
              Acosta/Mosaic Sales Solutions will maintain a written process for
              the development of documented individual accommodation plans for
              employees with disabilities.
            </p>

            <p>
              If requested, information regarding accessible formats and
              communications supports provided will also be included in
              individual accommodation plans.
            </p>

            <p>
              In addition, the plans will include individualized workplace
              emergency response information (where required), and will identify
              any other accommodation that is to be provided.
            </p>

            <h3>Return to Work Process</h3>

            <p>
              Acosta/Mosaic Sales Solutions maintains a documented return to
              work process for its employees who have been absent from work due
              to a disability and who require disability-related accommodations
              in order to return to work.
            </p>

            <p>
              The return to work process outlines the steps Acosta/Mosaic Sales
              Solutions will take to facilitate the return to work and will
              include documented individual accommodation plans as part of the
              process.
            </p>

            <p>
              This return to work process will not replace or override any other
              return to work process created by or under any other statute (ie.,
              the Workplace Safety Insurance Act, 1997).
            </p>

              individual accommodation plans, when conducting performance
              management, providing career development and advancement to
              employees, or when redeploying employees.
