    After an unprecedented year, forecasted trends include ongoing focus on personal health and self-care, technology activation acceleration and fulfillment efficiencies.


    Our Acosta Strategic Advisors and business leaders compiled their top CPG predictions for 2021, which include an unceasing emphasis on health and safety, accelerated advances in e-commerce, inspirational in-store shopping experiences, efficiencies with fulfillment, and consolidation and partnerships with retailers and manufacturers.


    Many of the changes we saw implemented in 2020 due to the pandemic will carry over into 2021. Health and safety will continue to be paramount for retailers and consumers, and e-commerce growth will continue on its accelerated path. Grocery shopping was not fun this year, and post-COVID, stores will need to make it a more enjoyable experience with unique offerings, better prices and stocked shelves.


    ## Acosta’s top CPG predictions for 2021, grouped into five categories, are:


    ### Health, Well-Being & Safety Are #1

    - Blurring of food at-home and away-from-home channels  

    - Self-serve food options in store are reinvented  

    - Personalized offerings become the norm  


    ### Fulfillment Efficiencies

    - Back room, dark store fulfillment rise to meet demand
