  At the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, Canadian small businesses were faced with unprecedented challenges. As a result, Digital Main Street partnered with organizations like Google, Facebook, MasterCard, and Shopify to focus on how they could support Canadian small businesses. As a result, Digital Main Street created ShopHERE powered by Google: a program that provides independent small businesses with a quick, easy and no-cost solution to get selling online right away. To do this, they paired college students and recent grads with small business owners, providing them with the right tools and resources to get their businesses online and achieve digital transformation.


  A $42.5 million investment from FedDev Ontario, and $7.45 million from the Province of Ontario brought together the Toronto Association of Business Improvement Areas, Communitech, Invest Ottawa and the Ontario Business Improvement Area Association to expand the Digital Main Street Platform and support more businesses going digital as a response to the impact of COVID-19 in Northern Ontario. A $1 million investment from Google Canada helped expand the program nationally.


  We worked closely with Digital Main Street and Google Canada to help scale this initiative with a goal of getting 50,000 small businesses online. Implementing a hiring strategy that prioritized diversity and inclusion, we played a role in training over 500 students and recent grads in critical digital transformation and e-commerce, pairing them with small business owners that needed such support to maintain growth.


  Do you know a small business looking to get online and start their digital transformation? Visit DigitalMainStreet.ca to learn more about ShopHERE powered by Google.


  We can help your brand build digital programs with a purpose. Email us at info@mosaic.com.
