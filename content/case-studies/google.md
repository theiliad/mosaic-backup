  To launch its radically helpful Pixel 4 smartphone, Google wanted a retail space where consumers could experience that helpfulness first hand. But what does a tangible environment look like for a brand that, until now, has lived in the cloud?


  Welcome to Pixelville. A retail experience designed as an interactive town square, built inside one of the largest carriers’ flagship retail stores.


  Starting in the hectic holiday season and spanning 10 weeks, the 450-square-foot blank space was transformed into an immersive journey through Google’s uniquely helpful and quirky world. Shoppers toured four ’stores’ along Pixelville’s Pixel St and Nest Ave: The Lens Gallery, the Motion Sense studio, the Astro Diner, and the Google Apartment. Inside each, BAs invited them to get hands on with the latest from Google in a number of contextually relevant demos.


  Pixelville tourists experienced AI innovations that don’t come through on spec sheets, camera capabilities you have to see to believe, and day-to-day features that, until now, you had to own the device to appreciate.


  Throughout the square, visitors collected limited-edition stickers and Google treats, before being handed off to a sales representative to learn more about how they could take their favorite product home.


  In total, Pixelville surpassed its goals with *46% conversion from intercept to demo, +35pt lift in purchase consideration for Pixel 4,* and *+15pt lift in purchase consideration for Nest Mini.*
